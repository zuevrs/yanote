# S05: Recovery placeholder summary

**Doctor-created placeholder.**

## What Happened
Doctor detected that all tasks were complete but the slice summary was missing. Replace this with a real compressed slice summary before relying on it.

## Verification
Not re-run by doctor.

## Deviations
Recovery placeholder created to restore required artifact shape.

## Known Limitations
This file is intentionally incomplete and should be replaced by a real summary.

## Follow-ups
- Regenerate this summary from task summaries.

## Files Created/Modified
- `.gsd/milestones/M002/slices/S05/S05-SUMMARY.md` — doctor-created placeholder summary

## Forward Intelligence

### What the next slice should know
- Doctor had to reconstruct completion artifacts; inspect task summaries before continuing.

### What's fragile
- Placeholder summary exists solely to unblock invariant checks.

### Authoritative diagnostics
- Task summaries in the slice tasks/ directory — they are the actual authoritative source until this summary is rewritten.

### What assumptions changed
- The system assumed completion would always write a slice summary; in practice doctor may need to restore missing artifacts.
